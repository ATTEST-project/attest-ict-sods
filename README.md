# SODS

A simple library for process ODS files in Java. It allows read/write ODS files.

This project contains the [original SODS] (https://github.com/miachm/SODS/tree/v1.5.1) code 
and includes a small fix to correctly handle exponential values.

Please refer to the original project's README for the generic library documentation.
